# Mouseover Wiki Plugin for SuperMemoAssistant

## Features

- Quickly preview wikipedia articles by hovering over links in SuperMemo.

## Installation

> Note: This plugin depends on the [Mouseover Popup plugin](https://github.com/bjsi/SuperMemoAssistant.Plugins.MouseoverPopup). Make sure you install it alongside Mouseover Wiki.

## Usage

Simply hover over wikipedia article links in SuperMemo to open the preview window. The popup window has buttons at the bottom of the window to extract the preview into your collection or open the full article in your browser.

### Settings

> You can access the settings of any SuperMemoAssistant plugin by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O and clicking the gear icon.

You can set the default priority of the imported extracts. You can also require that the ctrl key is pressed while hovering to open the window.
